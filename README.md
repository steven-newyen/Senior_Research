# Senior_Research
This project involves the research of machine learning methods and 
their ability to detect computer systems with malware. The objective 
of this proposal is to perform a comparative study between three different 
machine learning algorithms to discover which algorithm performs best in 
classifying malware and benign instances when given data from a dataset. 
This will aid future research into leveraging machine learning in the prevention 
and detection of future, more complex, malware. Anti-malware programs may also 
find this research valuable, as they could implement similar algorithms to 
counteract malware threats.
