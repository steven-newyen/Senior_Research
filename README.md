### A Comparative Study of Effectiveness Between Classical Classification Machine Learning Algorithms and Neural Networks 
This project involves the research of machine learning methods and 
their ability to detect computer systems with malware. The objective 
of this proposal is to perform a comparative study between three different 
machine learning algorithms to discover which algorithm performs best in 
classifying if malware has infected a system based upon the given data from 
a dataset. This will aid future research into leveraging machine learning in
the detection of future, more complex, malware. Anti-malware programs may also 
find this research valuable, as they could implement similar algorithms to detect 
malware threats.
